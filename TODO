   3 2011-11-28 import assistant: importer ask format; long descriptions
                should be a long wrappable line

   4 2011-11-28 have a padding (6) on top of gtkfilechooser (import &
                export assistants) not gtk3 : gtk2 only

   5 2011-11-28 already existing item when importing should keep the same
                size between invocations
     2011-11-30 this is ok on f14 f16 ubu10 and almost on ubu11
                (ubu11): z-order is ok the first time, but comes back to
                the previous behavior starting with the second time
                (maybe a theme problem ?)

   6 2011-12-06 after unsuccessfully tried to import via dnd:
                Gtk-CRITICAL **: gtk_tree_view_scroll_to_cell:
                assertion `tree_view->priv->tree != NULL' failed

   7 2011-12-22 export assistant
                when exporting a menu, only desktop format is available

   8 2011-12-22 export assistant
                the items list should it be presented as a flat list ?
                or as an expanded one ?

   9 2012-01-12 environment tab
                in the list of desktop checkboxes, the item which is not
                grayed is that which would be selected if the list would
                be active -> but should be grayed
                vubuntu10: exhibits the bug
                fedora14, fedora16, vubuntu11: ok

  10 2012-01-16 LXDE: unable to drag and drop to PcmanFM
                na_core_utils_dir_is_writable_uri( "/tmp" ):
                is_writable=False
                and desktop hangs

  11 2012-01-29 na-icontext.c:is_candidate_for_show_if_registered()
                implement GDBus

  12 2012-01-29: NactTreeModel is not released at end when dnd

  13 2012-02-14 opening the menubar triggers the on_tree_view_focus_out,
                thus disabling the edit items (this is not the desired
                behavior when we access a menu)
                Fedora14: OK
                Fedora16: bug exhibits
                Ubuntu10: OK
                Ubuntu11: bug exhibits
                This may have something to do with the way we manage the
                GtkActions
                Also see glade source.

  16 2012-10-19 the last commit - to disable xml2po usage - has introduced
                a regression
                target are evaluated even if not built (and so there is an
                error if we do not know any prerequisites)
                reproduce by building from an empty tree with --disable-manuals

  17 2011- 2-21 implement startup mode

  18 2011- 2-21 implement execute as user

  19 2010- 6-17 implement shortcut button in NactIPropertiesTab page

  20 2010- 8- 9 in v1.x until ??, %f used to be the basename!!

  21 2010-12-30 gtk-doc 1.15
                "Use of uninitialized value within %DeclarationTypes in
                lc at /usr/bin/gtkdoc-mkdb line 929" when building XML

  22 2011- 2- 7 is_level_zero_writable: should be monitored
                for now, is only evaluated when NAUpdater is instanciated

  23 2011-02-07 are_preferences_locked: should be monitored
                for now, is only evaluated when NAUpdater is instanciated

  24 2011-02-12 should we have a NAKeyFile shared between i/o-desktop and settings ?

  25 2011-02-23: implement item separator

  26 2011-02-23 desktop environment
                accept a default at compile time
                accept as a runtime user preference (may be mandatory)

  27 2011-06-08 when getting an elementary data, we should get the default value if it is not set ?
                to determine if a value is set, have a na_object_is_data_set (see na_object_item_deals_with_version)
                this should let us get ride of na_factory_object_set_defaults() function

  28 2011-06-08 get ride of NADataBoxed ?

  29 2011-11-29 exporter ask: add an option: do not import

  30 2011-11-29 exporter ask and importer ask, add a button cancel all

  31 2011-11-29 in IActionsList, be able to extend the selection just by dragging the mouse
                as in GtkFileChooser when selecting several files

  32 2011-12-04 support pkgconfig

  33 2011-12-04 support GObject introspection

  34 2011-12-10 document supported distributions

  35 2011-12-12 have an option to display two rows in nact when we have an
                action with only one profile (see #666093)

  36 2011-12-28 when in maintainer mode, disable all compiler optimizations

  37 2012-01-01 when keeping an hidden window, do not save/restore its position
                each time, just keep its current position

  38 2012-01-02 when importing items via dnd, the messages do not specify to
                which item they relate - but should!

  39 2012-01-05 libunique is deprecated (mail E. Bassi gtk-app-devel dec. 2011)
                GApplication may replace the feature since 2.30 (fedora 16 level)

  40 2012-01-28 when gio >= 2.30, remove dbus-glib

  41 2012-01-31 add a field on NADataDef to point when a data may embed some
                parameters and should be expanded in nautilus-actions plugin

  42 2012-02-01 have all tabs of the main window scrollable
                and keep their order in user settings

  43 2012-02-06 should be able to install even if docs are not present

  44 2012-02-09 review (one more time) the check_status calls
                before trying to insert an item, we check it and its children (or should so
                because the status of an object is not dependant of those of its parent)
                so the nact_tree_view_insert_items() functions family should only need to
                na_object_check_status_up()

  45 2012-02-14 review update sensitivities to take advantage (?) of GtkAction

  46 2012-02-14 a tree view status changed signal has not sense, rather define an
                object status changed

  47 2012-03-01 About nact: add documented by

  48 2012-10-10 when checking for utilities in configure.ac, check for all
                and only then display the result (so that we have all missing packages
                in one time)

  49 2012-10-11 should not block if GCONF devel library is not installed when
                --enable-gconf is auto

  50 2013- 9- 2 shouldn't check and require GConf if --disable-gconf
  
  51 2014- 2-25 see if uuid is always relevant

  53 2014- 4-29 base_gtk_utils_get_pixbuf: listen for icon theme changes

  54 2014- 4-30 base-assistant/dialog/window shouldn't include
                nact-application.h to have NACT_EXIT_CODE

                - io-gconf i/o provider
                - fma-print-schemas
                - gconf-migration code

  66 2015- 9-10 add json import/export

  67 2015- 9-10 element formalpara: validity error : Element formalpara
                content does not follow the DTD, expecting 
                (title , indexterm* , para), got (title para para )

  68 2015- 9-10 use AX_COMPILER_FLAGS

  69 2015- 9-10 use AM_GNU_GETTEXT instead of AM_GLIB_GNU_GETTEXT

  70 2015- 9-10 xmllint --noout --noent --path C:../../../../docs/user-manual/C --xinclude --postvalid ../../../../docs/user-manual/C/fma-config-tool.xml
                document does not validate

  71 2015- 9-11 replace FMADataFactory with GVariant ?

  73 2015- 9-17 gtk-doc: usage of templates is deprecated

  74 2015- 9-21 instead of:
                  whether GConf is required... no
                have:
                  whether GConf is enabled... auto
                  whether GConf is available... no|yes

  75 2017- 2-14 FMA-Message: base_gtk_utils_widget_set_color: to be written

  76 2017- 2-14 fma-menu::on_app_help() help file should be named fma-config-tool (same than the program)

  77 2017- 2-14 export assistant does not allow multiple selection

  86 2017- 2-14 enhancement.ui: review toolbars layout
                so that detacheable toolbars do not take so such big extra space

  86 2017- 2-14 enhancement.management: we should be able to fully export a configuration
                this implies exporting menus and full tree
                + restore hierarchy on import (see bug 626337)

  86 2017- 2-14 enhancement.ui: rows implicitely selected should have a special display
                (as a sort of 'transparent' selection)

  86 2017- 2-14 enhancement.ui: review statusbar layout
                do not add extra height to statusbar
                better encapsulate statusbar, lock indicator, possibly other indicators

  86 2017- 2-14 enhancement.config: na_pivot_is_level_zero_writable:

  86 2017- 2-14 export: add a overwrite page: what to do if file already exists ?

  86 2017- 2-14 IActionTab: check_label has became useless since validity is global

                unvalidity

  86 2017- 2-14 for each toolbar, let the user choose which buttons are displayed

  86 2017- 2-14 have a preference for modified and invalid fonts

  86 2017- 2-14 undo manager (at least Ctrl-Z)

 2010-08-20: add an item in the context menu to explain why other actions

  86 2017- 2-14 export-ask: the keep last choice check box should be as editable that export format

 DONE
 ====

   1 2011-11-15 an action with one profile - if the action has a property
                set to empty 'folders=' and the profile does not have the
                property set, then set_defaults on the profile set the
                default property (here, 'folders=/') instead of taking
                the action value. On the UI, updating an action's property
                means updating the current profile. This is ok as long as
                the action is also set  (...) there is one profile and the
                action's property was not the default
     2015- 9-21 ok (obsolete) as of 3.4

   2 2011-11-28 import assistant: intro label should be wrappable
     2017- 2-14 done

OTHER ENHANCEMENTS
==================
- GOptions request enhancement so that the help for an option could be
  multiline (by defining an optional maximum width)

- GConf Editor request enhancement: one should be able to refresh the hierarchy
  (F5 ?)

- Nautilus: implement menu separator for plugins

- 2012-06-04: review GnomeGoals https://live.gnome.org/GnomeGoals/

OTHER BUGS
==========
- 2011-02-21: nautilus: calls menu_provider_get_file_items() api each time we are
  activating a menu; as the call is made without any indication about the currently
  activated item, we have no other option than just recreate the menu; this is
  very expensive in computation time

- GLib bug for g_utf8_collate_key_for_filename()
  (see the 26 exported actions, and the screenshot of Nautilus view)

- Gtk bug: Nautilus doesn't display the actions in the order of the provided
  GList in its context menu (seems as if a cache would keep the actions which
  were already here the previous time - to be confirmed)

- Gtk bug: gtk_tree_path_up returns TRUE even if there is no parent
  cf. commit 5ee6938486cd82f1274969506873df950348dd61 and before
  function nact-tree-model.c::add_parent
  recreate a small code which reproduces this bug and open in bugzilla

- Nautilus bug when dnd to nautilus on other screen
  see https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=593453

- intltool: should implement standard targets for users
  (cf. 14.6 make.html GNU Make manual).
  As of 0.41.1, the absence of these standard targets prevents users
  (which are actually package developers) to provide any html, pdf, ...
  targets

- 2010-12-13: --enable-gtk-doc-pdf does not generate a pdf, but should

- 2011-02-23: it seems that Nautilus 2.30.1 calls get_file_items even when are 
  opening a submenu ?

- 2011-02-23: also it seems that Nautilus 2.30.1 free our menus (probably because 
  it is an item of its own menu), but not recursively the items of this menu.

- 2011-12-19: pcleantmp.sh doesn't handle filename with spaces

- 2012-01-23: docbook-utils-0.6.14
  db2html begins by emptying the target directory, even if it also
  contains the source file

- 2012-01-25: gnome-doc-utils: install target does not check if translations
  exist (e.g. sl/.xml) before trying to install, so aborts
  -> install should build translations before installing
  (the same way we compile programs before installing them)

- 2012-10-12: migrate from gnome-doc-utils to yelp
  see https://live.gnome.org/GnomeGoals/NewDocumentationInfrastructure

- 2012-10-15:
  MSGFMT is called four times at once
  while XML2PO is called once for each linguas
  we should rather have MSGFMT called besides of XML2PO

- 2012-10-15: install sshd and ssh keys on vubuntu8/10/11/12

- 2012-10-15; open all bugs in Bugzilla

- 2012-10-15: check the status of the Fedora bug which was opened about
  erroneous url - add a bug on help non being installed (not even packaged)

- 2012-10-17: it appears that de.xml doesn't validate

NOTES
=====
- Note about the schemas in Nautilus Actions:
  a) actions are identified by uuid
  b) so, all GConf keys have a path with the uuid of the action
  c) I'm not willing to write a schema for each and every uuid
  d) so, as of 1.11.2, the provided schema is general and should apply
     to all actions
  e) but there is not yet an API to set a GConfMetaInfo for a key
     note that gconftool-2 --dump is able to export for each entry a
     <schema_key> which includes the path to the general schema key
     but we cannot set it programatically (bad !)

- 20100408: gconf_concat_dir_and_key: have seen this as deprecated, but do not
  find again the reference :(
  not even in unstable library on the web
  http://library.gnome.org/devel/gconf/unstable/gconf-gconf.html#gconf-concat-dir-and-key

- "x-nautilus-desktop:///" is rather a scheme than a folder => actually is an URI

- default has changed for schemes (was coded as 'file' instead of '*')
  when version is recorded (as 1.4.1 or 2.0) then schemes is reliable
  when version is not recorded, it is a 2.30 serie, and scheme is not recorded when default (i.e. file)
  do not try to force anything than that, but this will have to be documented
