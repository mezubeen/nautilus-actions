  88 2017- 2-14 enhancement.management: we should be able to fully export a configuration

 110 2012-10-15 MSGFMT is called four times at once
                while XML2PO is called once for each linguas
                we should rather have MSGFMT called besides of XML2PO

 DONE
 ====

   1 2011-11-15 an action with one profile - if the action has a property
                set to empty 'folders=' and the profile does not have the
                property set, then set_defaults on the profile set the
                default property (here, 'folders=/') instead of taking
                the action value. On the UI, updating an action's property
                means updating the current profile. This is ok as long as
                the action is also set  (...) there is one profile and the
                action's property was not the default

   5 2011-11-28 already existing item when importing should keep the same
                size between invocations
     2011-11-30 this is ok on f14 f16 ubu10 and almost on ubu11
                (ubu11): z-order is ok the first time, but comes back to
                the previous behavior starting with the second time
                (maybe a theme problem ?)
     2017- 2-15 obsolete

   8 2011-12-22 export assistant
                the items list should it be presented as a flat list ?

                grayed is that which would be selected if the list would
                be active -> but should be grayed
                vubuntu10: exhibits the bug
                fedora14, fedora16, vubuntu11: ok
     2017- 2-15 obsolete

  13 2012-02-14 opening the menubar triggers the on_tree_view_focus_out,
                thus disabling the edit items (this is not the desired
                behavior when we access a menu)
                Fedora14: OK
                Fedora16: bug exhibits
                Ubuntu10: OK
                Ubuntu11: bug exhibits
                This may have something to do with the way we manage the
                GtkActions
                Also see glade source.

                a regression
                target are evaluated even if not built (and so there is an
                error if we do not know any prerequisites)

     2017- 2-15 no

  27 2011-06-08 when getting an elementary data, we should get the default value if it is not set ?
                to determine if a value is set, have a na_object_is_data_set (see na_object_item_deals_with_version)
                this should let us get ride of na_factory_object_set_defaults() function
     2017- 2-15 obsolete

     2017- 2-15 cancelled (as I no more know what it means)

  43 2012-02-06 should be able to install even if docs are not present
     2017- 2-15 cancelled as the whole documentation build needs full review

  44 2012-02-09 review (one more time) the check_status calls
                before trying to insert an item, we check it and its children (or should so
                because the status of an object is not dependant of those of its parent)
                so the nact_tree_view_insert_items() functions family should only need to
                na_object_check_status_up()

  48 2012-10-10 when checking for utilities in configure.ac, check for all
                and only then display the result (so that we have all missing packages
                in one time)
     2017- 2-15 done

  49 2012-10-11 should not block if GCONF devel library is not installed when
                --enable-gconf is auto
     2017- 2-15 done

                perl snippets to transform for configure.ac and 
                maintainer/run-autogen.sh
     2017- 2-15 no added value

  84 2010-09-30 export format and d&d format should be separated preferences
     2017- 2-15 no

  86 2017- 2-14 enhancement.ui: review toolbars layout
                so that detacheable toolbars do not take so such big extra space
     2017- 2-15 this appears to be no more the case

  91 2017- 2-14 enhancement.config: na_pivot_is_level_zero_writable:
                the provider which hosts the level-zero list of items should be a configuration option
