data/gconf-schemas
------------------
This directory contains schemas to be installed in GConf.

None of these schemas has been translated to new FileManager-Actions
naming scheme, as these are part of the GConf subsystemn, which we have
chosen to no more use. 

Note to translators.
--------------------
Only nautilus-actions-prefs-schemas.in may be translated in place.
Other files are automatically generated.
In particular, nautilus-actions-conf-schemas.in is generated from data
factory includes, and automatically takes into account translations
from po/ files.

Note to packagers.
------------------
Even if you choose to not actually install schemas in GConf at install
time, we will find back them in prefix/share/nautilus-actions/gconf-schemas/
subdirectory.
