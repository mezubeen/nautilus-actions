data/actions
------------
This directory contains some .desktop files as examples of actions or
menus. Actions cited in the FileManager-Actions Configuration Tool
user's manual are in particular here. These are some rather common
actions which could be used as starting examples by the user.

All actions in this directory are marked as 'disabled'. The packager is
so free to install them in XDG_DATA_DIRS/file-manager/actions without
cluttering the file manager itself.
