 * @short_description: #BaseBuilder class definition.
 * @include: nact/base-builder.h
 *
 * This class is derived from GtkBuilder class. It adds to it two
 * features:
 *
 * - do not load twice the .xml files;
 * - destroy Gtk toplevels at dispose time.
 *
 * A common #Basebuilder object is instanciated at #BaseWindow class level.
 * Each #Basewindow -derived object may later use this common #BaseBuilder
 * object, or allocate its own.
