 * @short_description: #NadpMonitor class definition.
 * @include: nadp-monitor.h
 *
 * This class manages monitoring on .desktop files and directories.
 * We also put a monitor on directories which do not exist, to be
 * triggered when a file is dropped there.
 *
 * During tests of GIO monitoring, we don't have found any case where a
 * file monitor would be triggered without the parent directory monitor
 * has been itself triggered. We, so only monitor directories (not files).
 * More, as several events may be triggered for one user modification,
 * we try to factorize all monitor events before advertizing NAPivot.
