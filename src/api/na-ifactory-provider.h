/**
 * SECTION: ifactory-provider
 * @title: NAIFactoryProvider
 * @short_description: The Data Factory Provider Interface v 1
 * @include: nautilus-actions/na-ifactory_provider.h
 *
 * &prodname; has to deal with a relatively great number of elementary datas,
 * reading them from different supports, storing and displaying them,
 * then re-writing these same datas, with several output formats, and so on.
 *
 * This has rapidly become a pain, if not just a bug generator.
 * Each new data must be described, have a schema to be stored in
 * (historical storage subsystem) GConf; import and export assistants
 * must be carefully updated to export the new data...
 *
 * The #NAIFactoryProvider aims to simplify and organize all the work
 * which must be done around each and every elementary data. It is based
 * on three main things:
 *
 * <orderedlist>
 *   <listitem>
 *     <formalpara>
 *       <title>Elementary datas are banalized.</title>
 *       <para>
 *         whether they are a string, an integer, a boolean, a simple
 *         or double-linked list, each elementary data is encapsuled
 *         into a #NADataBoxed, small sort of structure (incidentally,
 *         which acts almost as the new GLib #GVariant, but too late,
 *         guys :)).
 *       </para>
 *     </formalpara>
 *   </listitem>
 *   <listitem>
 *     <formalpara>
 *       <title>Our objects are de-structured.</title>
 *       <para>
 *         Instead of organizing our elementary datas into structures,
 *         our objects are just flat lists of #NADataBoxed.
 *       </para>
 *     </formalpara>
 *   </listitem>
 *   <listitem>
 *     <formalpara>
 *       <title>A full, centralized, data dictionary is defined.</title>
 *       <para>
 *         Now that our elementary datas are banalized and de-structured,
 *         it is simple enough to describe each of these datas with all
 *         iss properties in one single, centralized, place.
 *       </para>
 *     </formalpara>
 *   </listitem>
 * </orderedlist>
 *
 * Of course, I/O providers are good candidates to be users of this
 * #NAIFactoryProvider interface.
 *
 * Without this interface, each and every I/O provider must,
 * for example when reading an item, have the list of data to be
 * read for each item, then read each individual data, then
 * organize them in a I/O structure..
 * Each time a new data is added to an object, as e.g. a new condition,
 * then all available I/O providers must be updated: read the data,
 * write the data, then display the data, and so on..
 *
 * With this #NAIFactoryProvider interface, the I/O provider has just to
 * deal with reading/writing elementary types. It does need to know that
 * it will have to read, name, tooltip, description. It just needs to know
 * how to read a string.
 * And while we do not introduce another data type, the I/O provider
 * does not need any maintenance even if we add lot of new data, conditions
 * labels, and so on.
 *
 * So, this is the interface used by data factory management system for
 * providing serialization/unserialization services. This interface may
 * be implemented by I/O providers which would take advantage of this
 * system.
