/**
 * SECTION: iio-provider
 * @title: FMAIIOProvider
 * @short_description: The I/O Provider Interface
 * @include: filemanager-actions/fma-iio-provider.h
 *
 * The #FMAIIOProvider interface is defined in order to let both &prodname;
 * internal and user-provided external plugins provide read and write accesses
 * to their own private storage subsystem.
 *
 * &prodname; core does not provide by itself input/output code. Instead,
 * we entirely relies on input/output facilities provided by implementations
 * of this interface.
 *
 * &prodname; is bundled with several I/O providers.
 * Since version 3, the <literal>io-desktop</literal> I/O provider, which
 * implements the
 * <ulink role="online-location" url="http://www.filemanager-actions.org/?q=node/377/">DES-EMA</ulink>
 * specification, is the preferred way of storing (and sharing) items.
 *
 * The #FMAIIOProvider interface provides three types of services:
 * <itemizedlist>
 *  <listitem>
 *   <formalpara>
 *    <title>
 *     loading items
 *    </title>
 *    <para>
 *     Loading items is used both by the &nautilus; plugin, by the
 *     &fmact; program, and by the command-line utilities.
 *    </para>
 *   </formalpara>
 *  </listitem>
 *  <listitem>
 *   <formalpara>
 *    <title>
 *     creating, updating or deleting items
 *    </title>
 *    <para>
 *     Updating items is a feature only used by the &fmact; program and
 *     by some command-line utilities.
 *    </para>
 *   </formalpara>
 *  </listitem>
 *  <listitem>
 *   <formalpara>
 *    <title>
 *     informing &prodname; of extern modifications
 *    </title>
 *    <para>
 *     The I/O provider should inform &prodname; when an item happens to
 *     have been modified in the underlying storage subsystem.
 *    </para>
 *   </formalpara>
 *   <para>
 *    This feature is only used by the &nautilus; plugin and by the
 *    &fmact; program.
 *   </para>
 *   <para>
 *    The #FMAIIOProvider interface does not define specific monitoring
 *    methods (but you can also take a glance at #FMATimeout object).
 *    Instead, it is waited that the I/O provider module takes care
 *    itself of managing its own monitoring services at
 *    load/unload time, calling the fma_iio_provider_item_changed()
 *    function when appropriate.
 *   </para>
 *  </listitem>
 * </itemizedlist>
 *
 * These services may be fully implemented by the I/O provider itself.
 * Or, the I/O provider may also prefer to take advantage of the data
 * factory management (see #FMAIFactoryObject and #FMAIFactoryProvider
 * interfaces) services.
 *
 * <refsect2>
 *  <title>I/O provider identifier</title>
 *  <para>
 *   For its own internal needs, &prodname; requires that each I/O provider
 *   have its own identifier, as an ASCII string.
 *  </para>
 *  <para>
 *   In order to avoid any collision, this I/O provider identifier is
 *   allocated by the &prodname; maintainers team. If you wish develop
 *   yourself a new I/O provider, and so need a new provider identifier,
 *   please contact the maintainers (see filemanager-actions.doap at the
 *   root of the source tree).
 *  </para>
 *  <para>
 *   Below is a list of currently allocated I/O provider identifiers.
 *   This list has been last updated on 2010, Feb. 14th.
