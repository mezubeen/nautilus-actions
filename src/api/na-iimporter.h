 * @short_description: The Import Interface
 * @include: file-manager-actions/na-iimporter.h
 *
 * The #NAIImporter interface imports items from the outside world
 * into &prodname; repository (see #NAIIOProvider interface for how
 * these items will be later managed to be store somewhere).
 *
 * In version 1 of the #NAIImporter interface, &prodname; used to
 * provide the implementation with all was needed to be able to manage
 * the import process up to be ready for insertion, including the
 * deduplication if required.
 *
 * This used to put on the implementation the responsability to check
 * for the unicity of the imported identifier, maybe asking the caller
 * (via provided callback functions) what to do with it, maybe
 * reallocating a new identifier, and so on...
 *
 * Starting with &prodname; version 3.2, this interface is bumped to
 * a version 2 which greatly simplifies it.
 *
 * The I/O provider which implements the #NAIImporter interface is no
 * more required to check for existence of the imported items, but this
 * check is pushed back to the caller responsability.
 *
 * Rationale is that only the caller is able to check against a valid
 * repository in its current import context, while the #NAIImporter
 * provider should only be responsible to import an item in memory.
