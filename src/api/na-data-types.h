/**
 * NADataType:
 * @NA_DATA_TYPE_BOOLEAN:       a boolean
 *                              can be initialized with "true" or "false" (case insensitive)
 * @NA_DATA_TYPE_POINTER:       a ( void * ) pointer
 * @NA_DATA_TYPE_STRING:        an ASCII string
 * @NA_DATA_TYPE_STRING_LIST:   a list of ASCII strings
 * @NA_DATA_TYPE_LOCALE_STRING: a localized UTF-8 string
 * @NA_DATA_TYPE_UINT:          an unsigned integer
 * @NA_DATA_TYPE_UINT_LIST:     a list of unsigned integers
 *
 * Each elementary data which would take advantage of #NABoxed facilities
 * should be typed at instanciation time.
 *
 * #NAIFactoryProvider implementations should provide a primitive for reading
 * (resp. writing) a value for each of these elementary data types.
 *
 * <note>
 *   <para>
 * Please note that this enumeration may be compiled in by the extensions.
 * They must so remain fixed, unless you are prepared to see strange effects
 * (e.g. an extension has been compiled with %NA_DATA_TYPE_STRING = 2, while you
 * have inserted another element, making it to 3 !) - or you know what
 * you are doing...
 *   </para>
 *   <para>
 *     So, only add new items at the end of the enum. You have been warned!
 *   </para>
