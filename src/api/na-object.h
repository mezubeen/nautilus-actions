 *
 * This is the base class of all our data object hierarchy. #NAObject is
 * supposed to be used as a pure virtual base class, i.e. should only be
 * derived.
 *
 * All the API described here is rather private. External code should
 * use the API described in <filename>file-manager-actions/na-object-api.h</filename>.
