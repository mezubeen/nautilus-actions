 * @short_description: The Duplication Interface
 * @include: filemanager-actions/private/fma-iduplicable.h
 *
 * This interface is implemented by #FMAObject in order to let
 * #FMAObject -derived instance duplication be easily tracked. This works
 * by keeping a pointer on the original object at duplication time, and
 * then only checking edition status when explicitely required.
 *
 * As the reference count of the original object is not incremented
 * here, the caller has to garantee itself that the original object
 * will stay in life at least as long as the duplicated one.

 *    <para>
 *     Objects whose origin is NULL are considered as modified ; this is

 *   <listitem>
 *    <para>
 *     when a new object, whether is is really new or it has been pasted,
