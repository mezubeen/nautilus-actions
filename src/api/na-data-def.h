/**
 * NADataDef:
 * @name:             both the id and the canonical name.
 *                    Used when getting/setting properties.
 *                    Is defined in na-ifactory-object-data.h and must be globally unique.
 *                    Must be an invariant as it is known from plugin extensions.
 * @readable:         whether the data should be read on unserialization operations.
 *                    If FALSE, then no attempt will be made to read it
 *                    and the data will have to be set dynamically.
 *                    When a data has been written once (see below), and unless
 *                    special cases (see e.g. type), it should remain readable
 *                    even if it has becomen obsolete (for backward compatibility).
 * @writable:         whether the data is to be written on serialization operations.
 *                    If FALSE, then no attempt will be made to write it.
 *                    Mainly set to FALSE for dynamically set variables and
 *                    obsoleted ones.
 * @has_property:     whether a property should be set for this variable ?
 *                    Set to FALSE for obsolete variables.
 * @short_label:      short localizable descriptive name.
 *                    Used in GParamSpec and in schemas.
 * @long_label:       long, if not complete, localizable description.
 *                    Used in GParamSpec and in schemas?
 * @type:             the elementary NA_DATA_TYPE_xxx data type.
 * @default_value:    the default to assign when creating a new object.
 *                    This default is also displayed in command-line help
 *                    of file-manager-actions-new utility.
 * @write_if_default: write this value even if it is the default value ?
 *                    Should default to FALSE.
 * @copyable:         whether this data should be automatically copied when
 *                    we are duplicating an object to another ?
 *                    In all cases, the implementation is always triggered
 *                    by the copy() interface method.
 * @comparable:       whether this data should be compared when we
 *                    are testing two objects for equality.
 * @mandatory:        whether this data must be not null and not empty
 *                    when we are testing for validity of an object.
 * @localizable:      whether this is a localizable data when serializing or exporting.
 * @gconf_entry:      same entry is also used for GConf-based XML docs.
 * @desktop_entry:    entry in .desktop files.
 * @option_short:     the short version of a command-line parameter in file-manager-actions-new,
 *                    or 0.
 * @option_long:      the long version of the same command-line parameter in file-manager-actions-new,
 *                    or NULL.
 * @option_flags:     #GOptionFlags for the command-line parameter, or 0.
 * @option_arg:       the type of the option, or 0.
 * @option_label:     the localizable description for the variable in file-manager-actions-new.
 *                    Defaults to @short_label if NULL.
 * @option_arg_label: the localizable description for the argument.
 *
 * This structure fully describes an elementary factory data.
 * Each #NAIFactoryObject item definition may include several groups of
 * this structure.
