---------------
This is the FileManager-Actions plugin.

The plugin is intended to be dynamically loaded by the file manager.

Please put only here code relevant to the plugin, and to itself only.
I.e., code shared by the plugin with some other part of the package
should go to core/ runtime convenience library.
