/*
 * SECTION: ioptions_list
 * @title: NAIOptionsList
 * @short_description: The OptionsList Interface v 1
 * @include: core/na-ioptions-list.h
 *
 * The #NAIOptionsList interface is to be used when we have one option to choose
 * among several. The interface takes care of:
 * <itemizedlist>
 *   <listitem>
 *     <para>
 *       displaying the items, either as a radio button group or as a tree view,
 *       inside of a parent container;
 *     </para>
 *     <para>
 *       maybe displaying a tooltip and/or a pixbuf for each option;
 *     </para>
 *     <para>
 *       maybe adding an 'Ask me' option;
 *     </para>
 *     <para>
 *       setting a default option, identified by its identifier, which can
 *       be anything resolvable to a #gpointer value;
 *     </para>
 *     <para>
 *       returning the selected option as a #gpointer value;
 *     </para>
 *     <para>
 *       freeing the allocated resources at end.
 *     </para>
 *   </listitem>
 * </itemizedlist>
 *
 * In order this interface to work, each option has to be seen as a #GObject
 * -derived object, which itself should implement the #NAIOption companion
 * interface.
 *
 * Note that the instance which implements this interface is able to provide
 * several list of values. This is the reason why each list of values is
 * identified by its container inside of the window's instance.
 *
 * Instance initialization
 *
 * Rather that having to call a na_ioptions_list_instance_init() on each
 * instance implementation, we prefer to check when entering in each public
 * method for an 'initialized' flag both at the instance level and at the
 * container level.
 *
 * Alternative might be be to have the na_ioptions_list_instance_init()
 * initialization interface method, which itself connect to #BaseWindow
 * signals. But this would not prevent of initializing for both managed
 * containers...
 *
 * Initialization mainly consists of defining weak references both on
 * instance and on containers levels.
