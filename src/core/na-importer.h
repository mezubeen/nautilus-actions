/* @title: NAIImporter
 * @short_description: The #NAIImporter Internal Functions
 * @include: core/na-importer.h
 *
 * Internal FileManager-Actions code should never directly call a
 * #NAIImporter interface method, but rather should call the
 * corresponding na_importer_xxx() functions.
 *
 * Importing items is a three-phase operation:
 *
 * - first, just try to find an i/o provider which is willing to import
 *   the item;
 *   at this time, only some uris have been successfully imported
 *
 * - check then for existence of each imported item;
 *   depending of the preferred import mode, this may be an interactive
 *   process;
 *   at this time, the importation of some objects may have been cancelled
 *   by the user
 *
 * - last, and depending of the exact individual import mode of each item,
 *   insert new items or override existing ones in the referential of the
 *   import context.

 * The caller may provide this function in order to check for duplicates

 * The function should return the already existing item which has the same id

 * unique.
 *
 * If the caller does not provide its own check function, then each imported
 * item will be systematically renumbered (allocated a new identifier).
