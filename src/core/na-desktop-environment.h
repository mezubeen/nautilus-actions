/* @title: Desktop Environment
 * @short_description: Desktop Environment Utilities.
 * @include: core/na-desktop-environment.h
 *
 * The desktop environment is used with OnlyShowIn and NotShowIn keys of
 * our desktop files. Unfortunately, there is no consensus between desktops
 * on how to determine the currently running desktop.
 * See http://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/xdg/2009-August/010940.html
 * and http://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/xdg/2011-February/011818.html
 *
 * Waiting for such a consensus (!), we have to determine this ourself.
 * Two methods:
 * - letting the user select himself which is the currenly running desktop
 *   as a user preference
 * - try to determine it automatically.
 *
 * Known desktop environments are defined at
 * http://standards.freedesktop.org/menu-spec/latest/apb.html.
