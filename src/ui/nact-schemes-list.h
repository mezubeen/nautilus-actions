/**

 * @short_description: Schemes list view management.
 * @include: nact/nact-schemes-list.h
 *
 * This set of functions manages the schemes list view.
 *
 * Up to 2.30.x, two modes were possible:
 * - for action: the full list is displayed, and a check box is made active
 *   when the scheme is actually selected in the profile.
 *   Adding a scheme insert an editable new row (without the description).
 *   Inline edition of the scheme is possible.
 *   Removing a scheme is possible.
 * - in preferences, when editing the default list of schemes
 *   the 'active' checkbox is not displayed
 *   the two columns 'scheme' and 'description' are editable inline
 *   adding/removing a scheme is possible
 *
 * Starting with 2.31.x serie (future 3.0), the scheme conditions of a
 * #FMAIContext are handled by nact-match-list.{c,h} set of function.
 * This set of functions is only used:
 *  a) to edit the preferences
 *     add/remove scheme
 *     edit keyword and description
 *     In this mode, the widget is embedded in the Preferences notebook.
 *     Modifications are saved when user clicks the global OK button.
 *  b) to select a scheme from the default list
 *     schemes already used by the current #FMAIContext are marked as used
 *     edition of the current list is not available
 *     In this mode, widget is embedded in a dedicated #NactAddSchemeDialog
 *     dialog box
 *     OK returns the current selection (only available if current scheme
 *     is not already used)
 *     Cancel returns NULL.
