docs
----
As of FileManager-Actions 3.4, the documentation is composed of two
main parts:
- the Reference Manual describes all features of the product, rather
  targeting developers and packagers;
- the FileManager-Actions Configuration Tool User's Manual.

All the documentation, whether it targets users or developers, is made
of architecture-independent files, and so default to be included in the
distributed tarball.
